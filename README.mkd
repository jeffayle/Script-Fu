# Script-Fu
Just a collection of gimp scripts I've written. Put them in your `scripts`
folder.

## Camouflage (camoflage.scm)
Generates a camouflauge pattern on the current image in the specified
colours (Similar to the camouflage script that comes with gimp, but does
not create a new image).

Creates menu item `<Image>/Filters/Render/Camouflage`
